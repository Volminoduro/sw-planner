= Technologies choices

== IDE : Visual Studio Code

=== What is supposed to be the whole configuration for a easy-to-use development

== Engine : TypeScript

* How does it work ?

== Server : NodeJS

* The Express framework is this good ?

== Database : Firebase for managing webhook easily ? MongoDB ? 

=== How can it save the spells configuration as it's save in NoSQL

== ODM Reverse : http://typeorm.io/#/ ? Does this work with Firebase

== Continuous delivery ? Jenkins + Docker ? Sonar ? Travis for Github, can work with Heroku (HeroKu or Openshift can be suited for this purpose)

=== Continuous delivery should do this : get called from Github's hook, compile, test the code, (put out some metrics about performance, rules, sonar ?) then deploy if the rest is successfull.

=== How the whole packaging should be done ? Webpack, Grunt, Gulp, etc. ?

== Testing framework, Jest ?

= Software architecture

== Front-end (Node.js, TypeScript, Angular)

* Is handled by Node.js' back-end for the very first version, as it's the static repository.

* One-page-app : the first access load the whole dom template, then the rest is done through REST's calls to the back-end.

* It should be easy to export to another location.

== Back-end (Node.js, TypeScript, Firebase's ORM ?)

* Host by Node.js

* Should just have path to get called (allows call only from the front-end ?).

* Contains datas transformation, etc. This should have the ORM's transformation ?

== API (Node.js, minimal TypeScript ?)

* Should have a mechanic with API-keys to not allow everyone to call it.

== Continuous delivery (

= Spells into back-end

* The back-end should implements all the algorithm logic with all methods calls etc., but it should be something blank like abstract-interface function.

* The front-end have all the implementations of those abstract-interface functions.

* BEWARE : UNIT TEST IS REQUIRED. It should test that the implementation of method call exists, as a dynamic researcher. This will prevent from function renaming, deletion and creation (How to detect the methods from this interface ?)
